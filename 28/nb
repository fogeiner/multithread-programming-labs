I give you a rough picture, because the posix people usually claim that
they've never heard of C++:

Some implementations of pthreads support cleanup of C++ stackframes
during cancellation. They basically throw a hidden exception back to
the routine that launched the thread procedure, thereby invoking all
destructors. catch(...) catches this exception, of course, may perform
cleanup, but must rethrow the exception, because flowing out out the
handler would mean that the cancellation is cancelled, which isn't
supported.

So for you, this is correct:
catch(...)
{
printf("Inside catch...\n");
throw;
}
